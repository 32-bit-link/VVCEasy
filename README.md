# VVCEasy (Windows only)
VVCEasy is that you don't have to compile or/and coding to encode VVC (known as Versatile Video Codec). Simple. Easy. Encode. Decode

VVCEasy comes to one-easy of ffmpeg, vvenc, vvdec and YUView.

Installation: Go to releases and download latest version.

VVCEasy is not yet finished. I'm trying to work with codes. I'm not good coding programming, just simple coding.
Sorry to say that. I will give update, once I release news.

Source run: RUNVVCEASY.bat

# Encode/Decode (easy)

Before you run of RUNVVCEASY.bat or VVCEASY.exe, you need to change input from file name to input.mp4 (as example)
Follow the instructions, the commands will give your options.
